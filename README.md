# COVID-Employment-Analysis-Report
The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a spike in unemployment numbers in Canada. A cursory glance at the data, as well as previous research has indicated that this is very likely due to the pandemic lockdown. What has not been definitively determined, however, is the regional effects of the pandemic on employment numbers. This study determines the degree to which the risk of unemployment increases over time due to the pandemic, and most importantly, how it differs between different regions in Canada. We use data from January 2017 to January 2021 to employ a logistic regression on the year-over-year change of employed persons. We find that the risk of an inferior employment condition increases by 1.1% nationally every month due to the pandemic, with Atlantic Canada faring the worst, followed by Western Canada, and Central Canada faring the best.

Note that all of this data was taken from data published by StatCan.
